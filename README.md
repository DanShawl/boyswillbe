# Boys Will Be

A headless ecommerce website built for Boys Will Be fashion brand; a brand dedicated to reframing masculinity. The client wants a website with an extremely minimal UI approach combined with a simple to use user experience. Eventually, the client would like to incorporate a blog component to improve SEO and provide useful resources and information about masculinity. This website is still being built but a live version is available.

## How its made:

**Technology used:**  JavaScript, React, NextJS, Shopify, TailwindCSS, HTML

This utilizes NextJS for performance and user experience optimization, and Shopify for back-end infrastructure by implementing the Storefront API and Buy SDK. 

Initially, I looked into two options to solve this clients needs: Shopify and WordPress. A fully custom built e-commerce site seemed unneccessary for the clients needs, and there was no reason to re-invent the wheel when great platforms already exist that solve this problem. However, two issues were present: preference for Shopify CMS over WordPress and lack of customization with Shopify (to the clients needs). So I looked into headless ecommerce solutions to retain the customizability of a custom storefront, but with simple and easy-to-use Shopify CMS using the Shopify Storefront API. 

Headless ECommerce was a new territory of development for me, so I looked into various solutions and settled on a relatively familiar framework to handle the frontend - NextJS. NextJS made routing, overall website performance, and serverside operations easy to build on, plus the component based building that React utilizes made it possible to quickly build out a consistent frontend UI.
